# Wanderlust Travel Planner
An travel planning app where a user can add different destinations and keep track of the trips they went into, with all of the expenses.

# API Documentation
In the following docs, I will use ***HOST*** as a placeholder for the domain on which the application is running.

* Login route: POST ***HOST***/login (need to pass username and password for "Basic" authentication)

After authentication, the JWT is set in the response header with header name: "token". This token needs to be used for all of the successing requests.

## User APIs
